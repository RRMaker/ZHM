            We are Zebrafish GenetiX, a team of 3 students from the University of North Texas 
            who came together to solve a major problem in zebrafish hemostasis research. Recently, we
            all joined the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science @ UNT, an early-college program for high-schoolers,
            which offers college-level courses, motivated UNT communities, and real science research opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this program, we got to know each other well and realized how serious the problems
            in current zebrafish hemostasis research were. Combined with our complementary skills, 
            that realization led us to form this team. <strong>(Click the images)</strong>

    <!-- Devank -->
    <div id="devank" class="team-bio">
        <p>
            <strong>Devank</strong> is the biological brains of the project. He brings extensive experience
            in zebrafish hemostasis assays from his research under Pudur Jagadeeswaran at UNT.
            His role ensures the solution is practical and works as planned for real labs.

        <p style="margin-top: 18px;"><strong>3 Fun Facts:</strong></p>

        <p>
            <strong>1.</strong> He's worked on this project so much that he's started dreaming about zebrafish —
            he can't look at an aquarium without thinking about them.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>2.</strong> Playing guitar is his mental reset button. It's his best way to wind down 
           after hours of studying for calculus and anatomy tests.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>3.</strong> He's a huge theater fan! He loves watching movies repeatedly 
           and seeing things he didn't see before.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Rohan -->
    <div id="rohan" class="team-bio">
        <p>
            <strong>Rohan</strong> oversees the business and strategic components of the project. He previously
            founded a four-figure social sports startup and won multiple national business
            competitions, shaping the mission, design, and market potential.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 18px;"><strong>3 Fun Facts:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> Pokemon TCG Pocket has been his most played game. He mainly like trading cards with other people,
           and even joins Facebook groups dedicated to trading cards. He prefer physical ones, 
           but they're very hard for him to get.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> He's a foodie at heart! He loves walking to random places with friends
            and trying new foods, going out with his family to a classic restaurant, getting together for
            a special occasion, or just ordering takeout.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3.</strong> He's not a huge vacation person. Contrary to the general public, he would rather stay
            in his area and do fun things with the people around him rather than go to extravagant places
            and take Instagram photos.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Gagan -->
    <div id="gagan" class="team-bio">
        <p>
            <strong>Gagan</strong> is the engineer of the group. Drawing from physics simulation research and
            advanced coding projects, he built the website and machine learning segmentation
            model that powers the innovation.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 18px;"><strong>3 Fun Facts:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> He usually keeps a Rubik's Cube at his desk to fidget with while working on something. 
           Like Devank's guitar, it's his personal mental reset device. He particularly likes focusing 
           on the patterns.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> He enjoys heading out on clear nights and seeing which constellations he can identify
            by memory alone. It's a peaceful passtime that connects to his love of astronomy.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> Soccer is his favorite sport, as it keeps him very active. The focus, teamwork, and social
           time he gets from it is really rewarding to him. He loves a good match with friends.
        </p>
